Ownership/License Disclaimer
----------------------------

This project originally began as a direct fork of *HTTP Servats Module* with
the intent of fixing some bugs, oversignts and shortcomings of that module. Over the
course of this development it turned into a major rewrite of (almost) the entire module.

As such, it contains similar (if not outright equivalent) logic, ideas, and code. Any
code not re-written is licensed under the *BSD License* and is copyright the respective
owner(s).

Please see the `ngx_http_extended_status_module <https://github.com/nginx-modules/ngx_http_extended_status_module>`_
`README <https://github.com/nginx-modules/ngx_http_extended_status_module/blob/master/README>`_
for possibly applicable additional licensing and copyright information.
