## Ownership/License Disclaimer

This project originally began as a direct fork of *HTTP Servats Module* with
the intent of fixing some bugs, oversignts and shortcomings of that module. Over the
course of this development it turned into a major rewrite of (almost) the entire module.

As such, it contains similar (if not outright equivalent) logic, ideas, and code. Any
code not re-written is licensed under the BSD License and is copyright the respective
owner(s).

Please see the [ngx_http_extended_status_module](https://github.com/nginx-modules/ngx_http_extended_status_module)

for possibly applicable additional licensing and copyright information.
